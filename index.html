            <p>Rajendra Prasad (3 December 1884 – 28 February 1963) was an Indian politician, lawyer, journalist and
                scholar who served as the first president of India from 1950 to 1962. He joined the Indian National
                Congress
                during the Indian independence movement and became a major leader from the region of Bihar and
                Maharashtra. A
                supporter of Mahatma Gandhi, Prasad was imprisoned by British authorities during the Salt Satyagraha of
                1930 and the Quit India movement of 1942.</p>
            <p>When India became a republic in 1950, Prasad was elected as its first president by the Constituent
                Assembly. As president, Prasad established a tradition for non-partisanship and independence for the
                office-bearer and retired from Congress party politics. Although a ceremonial head of state, Prasad
                encouraged the development of education in India and advised the Nehru government on several occasions.
                In 1957, Prasad was re-elected to the presidency, becoming the only president to serve two full terms.
                Prasad stayed in office for the longest term of around 12 years. Post the completion of his tenure, he
                quit the Congress and set up new guidelines for parliamentarians which are still followed.

                        He joined the famed Calcutta Presidency College in 1902. His scholarship, ironically, would pose
                        the first test of his patriotism. Gopal Krishna Gokhale had started the Servants of India
                        Society in 1905 and asked him to join. So strong was his sense of duty toward his family and
                        education that he, after much deliberation, refused Gokhale. But the decision would not rest
                        easy on him. He recalled, “I was miserable” and for the first time in his life his performance
                        in academia declined, and he barely cleared his law examinations. </p>
